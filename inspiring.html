<p>Thomas Edison was born in February 11, 1847 Milan, Ohio U.S and died October 18, 1931. He was born to a family of modest means. Despite a lack of formal education, Edison became fascinated with 
    science and technology from an early age. He was a voracious reader and taught himself much of what he knew. At the age of 16, he began working as a telegraph apprentice in 1863. Edison had
     a patial deafness, but this 
    didn't hindered him from learning.
</p>
<span class="read-more-text"> <p>He devoted  most his time toward improving  inchoate equipment and inventing device to facilitate some of the tasks that is physical limitation made difficult. 
    By January 1869 he had made enough progress  with a duplex telegraph ( a device capable of transmitting two messages simultaneously on one wire) and a printer, which converted electrical signals to letters.
    Edision moved to New York City, where he went into partnership with Frank L. Pope, an electrical expert  to produce the Edision Universal Stock Printer and other printing telegraph.

    And he was always coming up with new inventions, including the motion picure camera and the electric pen. even thou he failed many times, he never give up. 
It took him years of hard work and many setbacks to finally succeed. But is persistence paid off and this lightbulb revolutionized the world today. He famously said <strong> "I have not failed, I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work"  </strong> </p>
